	<p> Note from the Author </p>
	<p>This is a website I made for fun containing as much Dragon Nest content I am willing to research or have experience with. It's basically a wiki I created for the game with my own personal design and ideas; the original reason I made this site was to practice my HTML, but after a while I found it pretty fun to design the site and decided to devote more time into making it better. After getting an introduction from codecademy.com (nice site that teaches you some coding language basics) I figured the fastest way to really learn was to just try coding, and I ended deciding to do that with Dragon Nest, so this is my first ever website. And of course I asked my good friends Bladexer and Nuclearshock to help me out with some of the content due to them having more game time/experience overall than me. I find DragonNest to be pretty versatile in terms of gameplay while making use of the more fun elements of MMORPGS (don't get me wrong there's plenty of flaws), and it just so happened to be a game I was actively playing so I picked it over other games. Again, this was all made for fun/practice so critique is nice but remember we don't really know what we're doing; it's like a big experiment.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, since we are just regular gamers trying to write what little that we know, you may not agree or like our descriptions or content. However, we are open to helpful feedback or suggestions on content/info that needs to be added or changed! Just leave us a note in the Contact Us section and if we decide to add it in we'll cite your name near change!</p>
	<p>Do note that most of the information/pictures on here are taken from the main site, the wiki, or various sites I have cited in the credits page (lmk if I missed something) and in some cases like the News, it will link directly to the source as they will have the most detail on the subject, but we may include a personal rundown. Despite how simple this site started out, I decided to share it with the community and get some feedback. Thanks for checking it out! </p>
	
	<p class="notes">FAQ</p>
	
	<p>Q: What does it mean when PVE/PVP aren't specified?</p>
	<p>A: PVE is PVE only, PVP is PVP only, and no specification is both.</p>
	<p class="notes">Q: When are you gonna update the page?</p>
	<p>A: That's a good question.. I'm not totally sure about that myself yet but depending on how busy I am but since Dragon Nest doesn't update/change meta all that fast, it should be whenever we feel something has changed whether its the game or our opinions. The "Updated for ___" should tell you if something's changed recently. The 3R Revamp is a huge change so it would take some time if I decided to do it.</p>
	<p class="notes">Q: How come some class pages have their icons at the top and some don't?</p>
	<p>A: If there's an icon, that means that either have us have played that class and think we probably know enough to speak about it from personal experience. No icon means we're writing about it from what we've observed or read about, but have never actually played.</p>
	<p class="notes">Q: What is wrong with this website the format/design/fonts are all whack!!</p>
	<p>A: This is a combination of lack of design experience, HTML experience, and/or figuring out how to make formats stay sane on different browsers/resolutions (Created mainly on Firefox with 1680 x 1050)</p>
	<p class="notes">Q: Can we suggest/bitch about anything else to you guys?</p>
	<p>A: Yeah, sure! Just head over to the Contact Us page, and we may or may not reply through the email you'll probably want to provide. Or else we might reply through the site itself, be warned.</p>
	<p class="notes">Q: What if I think there's another useful build/perspective on a class (or anything else) that I think could be implemented?</p>
	<p>A: Really, we could use all the help we can get with content since we're only working on this site with some extra extra free time.</p>
	<p class="notes">Q: Who ARE you?</p>
	<p>A: Just a computer science major trying to code some personal projects. And, obviously, a gamer who's played a bit of Dragon Nest. </p>
