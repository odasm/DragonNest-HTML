	<h3 class="titles" color="white" id="rundown">Current Patch Rundown</h3>
	<p id="bullnotes">-The upcoming revamp is a HUGE update for Dragon Nest and has already been released in Korea! That means after a little fixing up the revamp should be hitting NA in a few months. Here's a quicker rundown of all the changes:</p>
	<div>	
	<p id="notestitle">-New level 90 limit, including new dungeons and town.</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-Machina is being released (actually came out in KR before the revamp).</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-Leveling will be faster.</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-There is new gear that will be released without class restriction, "B-grade" and "A-grade".</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-Most party buffs are converting to self buffs only, and some debuffs are being moved around or removed.</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-All classes are having their numbers revamped to balance them out. This means DPS classes should theoretically do around the same amount, depending on if you're using high or low cd abilities, "Damage output largely depends on control and aggressiveness of player". </p>
	<p id="notestitle">-All classes are gaining new passives called "EX Instant"s where you can fire off an enhanced EX directly after using a specific skill. This is essentially giving classes a quick EX skill combo that includes some bonus passives with it.</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-At level 90 there are new Hero skills that can be learned by all classes (buffs and a heal). </p>
	<p id="notestitle">-A new UI is being added specifically for classes that use bubbles or counters.</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-Max MP is being changed (flat, and the same). The only skills that have MP costs now are the skills that will have EX. Once EX is learned, the mana cost is doubled.Little mp regen, only healers get more.</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-Stat to damage ratio's have been modified (in most cases classes won't have secondary offensive stats).</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-A couple of skills have received some changes (Swordmaster Parry abilities are being fused, Saints Holy Shield -> % health aoe heal, etc.)</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-AoE healing abilities are supposedly sharing CDs. </p>
	<p id="notestitle">-Party synergy is being pushed into place: each class is either dps, supporter, tanker (defense mechs, taunt), or healer (1 AoE heal, 1 continuous heal/mp regen)</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-Lower survivability classes will have dps advantages.</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-"enhance and equalize the mobility of all classes" whatever that could mean.</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-Equips only have 1 slot for dragon gems, which have been fused into 1 type.</p>
	<p id="notestitle">-Stats gained from enhancing items has been reduced (as well as easier?).</p>
