# DragonNest-HTML
HTML5/CSS summer project for the MMORPG Dragon Nest (the ins and outs of playing the game)

OPEN WITH index.html

This is my very first HTML projected made in order to help me learn how to use HTML5/CSS. It includes backgrounds, buttons, links, mouseovers, custom fonts, pictures, and other basic features. I learned the basics with the help of codeacademy and then taught myself the rest online.
